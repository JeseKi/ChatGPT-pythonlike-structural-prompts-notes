# ChatGPT-pythonlike-structural-prompts-notes
A Python-like method for writing structured prompts.

## Handbook Content

***Translated from Chinese to English by GPT-4.***

In the preface of the handbook, I introduce my journey of writing structured prompts and the classification of structured prompts.

**Chapter 1** introduces the basic structure of my structured prompts, which includes 4 parts:
- Role definition section
- Functionality section  
- Rule section
- Instantiation section

**Chapter 2** focuses on the importance of separators in structured prompts.

**Chapter 3** explains in detail how to define roles.

**Chapter 4** introduces how to implement functionalities, including basic functions and functional functions.

**Chapter 5** explains the role of the rule section.

**Chapter 6** introduces how to use encapsulation to improve the reusability of structured prompts.

**Chapter 7** and **Chapter 8** are advanced sections, providing a more detailed introduction to separators and functions. Those who want to write more complex functional prompts can take a look.

## Usage

This handbook uses [GPT Pseudocode code interpreter](/Books/prompts/GPT伪代码解释器.md##CN) as the main example prompt, as it is the basic template for most of my functional prompts.

The focus of the handbook is on functional prompts, suitable for those who want to write complex and reusable structured prompts.

I suggest you first read the basic parts in the first 6 chapters, and if you want to write more complex prompts, proceed to the advanced parts in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8.

Although functional prompts are written in a programming style, GPT itself has strong comprehension abilities, so there is no need to strictly adhere to programming conventions.

### Functional prompts in the prompts folder

**Currently, the latest version of my prompts is 3.2.0, synchronized with the code interpreter.**

The following prompts have historical versions in their respective files. Please use the latest version as much as possible for interpreting structured prompts. From top to bottom, the latest updates to each prompt correspond to newer to older times. **Some prompts have English versions in the file, indicated by the prefix `EN`.**

- [EN GPT Pseudocode Code Interpreter](/Books/prompts/GPT代码伪解释器.md)
- [EN Claude Translator](/Books/prompts/Claude翻译机.md)
- [GPT Problem-solving Teacher](/Books/prompts/GPT题目解决老师.md)
- [EN GPT4 Programming Assistant](/Books/prompts/GPT4编程助手.md)
- [Expert Mind Simulation](/Books/prompts/专家思维模拟.md)
- [GPT Meme Generator](/Books/prompts/GPT梗图生成器.md)
- [Acronym Generator](/Books/prompts/单词简写生成器.md)

The rest of the prompts are descriptive prompts

## Future Plans

The content of this handbook is not yet complete. I plan to supplement the remaining chapters as soon as possible within the next week.

- Improve the output function section
- Practice
- Views on the future of prompts

After completing the Chinese version, I plan to translate it into English to allow more people to understand my method of writing structured prompts.
